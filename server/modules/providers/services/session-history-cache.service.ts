/**
 * Full-transcript cache for session history reads.
 *
 * Every provider history reader materializes the complete normalized
 * transcript and then slices out the requested page, so serving a 20-row page
 * of a large session re-read and re-parsed the whole transcript file on every
 * request — opening a session, each older page while scrolling up, and every
 * post-turn refresh. For a multi-megabyte JSONL that is most of a second of
 * CPU per request.
 *
 * Entries are keyed by app session id and validated with one `stat` per
 * request against the transcript file's identity (path + mtime + size), so
 * only the first read after the file changes pays the parse. Anything that
 * rewrites history (a new turn, an edit, a rewind, a fork) touches the file
 * and invalidates naturally.
 *
 * One thing the file cannot tell: whether the CLI process behind the session
 * is still running. Claude's history reader answers a background agent's
 * status from that, so a session's entry is also dropped explicitly when its
 * process starts or ends (`invalidate`) — otherwise a page read while the
 * process was up would keep reporting `running` after it had gone, until the
 * next row happened to land in the file.
 *
 * Only history readers that read `jsonl_path` itself may use this cache —
 * callers pass `transcriptPath: null` for providers whose messages live
 * elsewhere (Cursor's store.db, OpenCode's shared SQLite), which bypasses
 * caching entirely.
